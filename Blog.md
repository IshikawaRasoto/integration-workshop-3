The feedback from the first week was the approval to continue develop our proposal A and also bring another idea. For this week, the team is supposed to deliver in more details both ideas.

## 1st Week (27/03/25 - 02/04/25)

As requested by the professors, the video below has a 10 minutes presentation about 3 proposals of projects to be developed during the course.

### A. Musicalization Project

The musicalization project has the objective to engage children in learning musical theory. Our proposal looks formward to the development of a table in which children can position pieces in a board which will represent the musical notes. The user will be able to control tempo, choose the instrument sound of which the system will play the notes, will have 2 or 3 octaves that can be chosen by the user. 

### B. Commercial Bafometer and Personal Bafometer

Project B seeks to solve a problema common in most of young adults lives. How to know if you are already sober after a session of drinking. Looking to solve this problem, our team is proposing the development of a system which will tell if a person is able to drive, and from this device, we'll be able to predict when a person will be able to drive by his metabolism, and also develop a system for places which sell drinks to ensure that, if someone is driving, he will only be able to take his car keys if he is sober and suited to drive.

### C. Parking Efficiency

Project C has the objective to solve a problem common in parking lots of concerts and shopping malls in events. The idea is to develop a smart system that will control the flow of vehicles entering and exiting the shopping mall in the most efficient way.
