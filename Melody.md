# Melody

## Intro

Nowadays many music teachers complain about the lack of interest that children are presenting toward learning new instruments and therefore music theory, due to the fact that new generations are presenting difficulties when dealing with frustration.
Instruments such as piano and violin present a difficult learning curve, of which many children show the behaviour of not having the patience to pass through the initial stages of boring exercises and learning to read musical sheets.

With this problem in mind, we propose the development of an embedded system that will serve as an auxiliary tool for music teachers to teach their students about music sheets and music theory. It will catch the children attention by letting them position the notes in a music sheet template and leeting them hear the melody.

## Project description

The project will work arround a wood board that will be painted on top with a music sheet template.

As shown above, the music sheet will contain 4 compass and the treble clef. Each compass will have 4 tempos in which the user will be able to place a music note. The range of notes will be limited to the following interval:
