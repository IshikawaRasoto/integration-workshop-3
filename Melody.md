# Melody - MElodic LOgic for DYnamic learning üéµ

## Intro üéº

Nowadays many music teachers complain about the lack of interest that children are presenting toward learning new instruments and therefore music theory, due to the fact that new generations are presenting difficulties when dealing with frustration.
Instruments such as piano and violin present a difficult learning curve, of which many children show the behavior of not having the patience to pass through the initial stages of boring exercises and learning to read musical sheets.

With this problem in mind, we propose the development of an embedded system that will serve as an auxiliary tool for music teachers to teach their students about music sheets and music theory. It will catch the children attention by letting them position the notes in a music sheet template and leeting them hear the melody.

## Project description üìã

The project will work around a wood board that will be painted on top with a music sheet template.

The system in it's default mode of operation will be able playing the melody in a loop as represented below:

The second mode of operation will be a mode that the system will tell by it's interface to the kid which note it wants. The melody will be pre-determined by a pre-loaded song.

The third mode will be similar to the second one, it will also want the children to place notes determined by a pre-loaded song. However, the interface will be by sound, the system will play the note and the user should place the note in the right place by it's frequency.

## Meeting with Professor Ellen Carolina Ott - CAART üéªüí¨

A meeting was done with professor Ott to present our project and ask for her opinion. She stated that the project was spectacular and she has been trying to find a project with these characteristics for years. Even abroad she didn't find anything like ours. She suggested to implement more colors and different notes tempos. Ms. Ott thinks that the project is great, and it would have a really meaningful impact in the way that music teachers interact with their students.

## Components üì∑

We presume the system will have the following items:

- Raspberry PI 4 B
- WebCam
- Board
- 2x light sources
- Speaker
- Music Notes (flats, sharps and naturals)
- Power Supply
